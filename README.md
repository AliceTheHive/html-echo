=========

`html-echo` dumps HTML bound to a String property directly into the DOM. The web component is built with [Polymer 1.x](https://www.polymer-project.org).

This components is hopefully obsolete sooner or later once Polymer supports directly dumping-HTML. See [Support question](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/1778#issuecomment-110072317)

To install the element:

`bower install html-echo`
